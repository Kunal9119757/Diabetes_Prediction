It is a Diabetes Prediction Model that helps predict the weather a patient
has diabetes or not.
First, we have a uncleaned data,by using various technique we cleaned our data
and made the data suitable to train the model.
Then we performed various operations on data to know more about the data.
we split our data in 2 parts 80% for training and 20% for testing. 
Then we trained our model on various algorithim like SVM,Logistic regression,
Decision Tree and Random forest
we got the maximum accuracy from Random forest of 99%.
The model is then saved to the hard disk using the pickle library and the model
is saved in the .PKL extension
Then we used flask to develop web application for the model to provide it a interface.
Our model has various input parameters so before using the model read the following :

INPUT PARAMETERS :
1. Gender :
	Input 1 for Male and  for 0 Female

2. Age : age of the person 

3. Urea : urea test

4. Cr : Chromium test resultt

5.HbA1c : Hemoglobin A1C test shows average blood sugar level

6.chol : Cholestrol test

7.TG : Thyroglonulin  test

8.HDL : High-density lipoprotien test(good cholestrol)

9.LDL :Low-density Lipoprotien test(bad chloestrol)

10.VLDL :very-low-density lipoprotien test

11.BMI :body-mass index
